## What is Rafay?

The Rafay Kubernetes Operations Platform (KOP) is a modern operations approach for modern infrastructure enabling organizations the abilty to manage the full lifecycle of your Kubernetes infrastructure and modern applications in a single, easy to use, shared services platform.

## How does Rafay Help Make Life Easy for Platform and SRE Teams?
As Kubernetes becomes more mature through Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) projects it's becoming more complex and harder to manage at scale which is leading to increased costs, time to support, and actually inhibiting/stalling/preventing modernization efforts. Rafay combines key services that are required to run Kubernetes at scale into a single centralized platform that delivers enterprise grade Kubernetes operations. Kubernetes operations is a holistic approach that unifies the lifecycle management of both Kubernetes clusters and containerized applications. With Rafay, teams that are required to operate and/or enable other teams in an enterprise to operate Kubernetes take advantage of the following Rafay KOP services -- across both clusters and applications:
